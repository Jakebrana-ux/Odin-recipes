    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The night before you want to make the piza, prepare the dough - mix 640 grams of flour, 360grams of water, 14 grams of salt and .3 grams of yeast together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the dough no longer sticks to the bowl move it to a covered container and proof for 1 hour. After 1 hour remove the dough and knead it back into a ball and proof overnight. In the morning remove the dough, knead it and cut it into 4 equal parts and roll them into balls. Place the balls back in the container and continue proofing until you are ready to make the pizza.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, simmer the pureed and sun dried tomatoes on medium-low heat until they reach your desired thickness, add salt and pepper to flavor.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to its' highest temperature, usually 500 degrees for domestic ovens</li>
        <li>Place the dough balls onto a plate of flour and press the middle outward until a thick outer crust is formed, continue to stretch outward until a roughly 10 inch pizza is formed</li>
        <li>Spread your sauce across the top of the dough until you can no longer see the dough beneath it</li>
        <li>Top with the mozzerella, parmesan, basil, salt and pepper. Drizzle olive oil across the toppings.</li>
        <li>Cook at highest oven temperature (usually 500) for about 6-8 minutes, preferrably on a pizza stone.</li>
        <li>Top with any extra parmesan, salt or pepper to taste. Let it cool, then enjoy an authentic taste of Italy!</li>
